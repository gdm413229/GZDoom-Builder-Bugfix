# Welcome to GZDoom Builder GL!

GZDoom Builder is a map editor for Doom, Heretic, Hexen and Strife based games mainly geared towards the GZDoom source port.

GZDoom Builder GL is an effort to port it over from Direct3D 9 to OpenGL. The main purpose of this is to improve cross platform support as Direct3D is a Windows only technology. As a result, this version of GZDoom Builder can be built natively on Linux using the mono toolset.

**System requirements:**
- Graphics card with OpenGL 3.2 support
